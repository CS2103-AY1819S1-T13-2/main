== Summary of contributions

* *Code contributed*: [https://nus-cs2103-ay1819s1.github.io/cs2103-dashboard/#=undefined&search=NgeowXiuQi[Functional code]]

* *Major enhancement*: Implemented four new fields for a staff, namely : Salary, Overtime Hours, Overtime Rate and Pay Deductibles.
** What it does: This feature allows the HR department to store all financial aspects for a staff and ensure they are properly accounted for.
** Justification: This feature not only allows the staff to ensure that he/she is being paid the right amount, but also helps the HR department to store these information in their records and edit them should there be any changes.
** Highlights: The four new fields is able to behave seamlessly as part of the Staff and behaves just like the other attributes like Phone and Address. The HR staff would also be able to edit the four fields whenever necessary
to allow changes (such as a pay raise or when the user has worked more overtime hours).

* *Minor enhancement*:
** Modified the "Edit" command to take in four new prefixes to allow editing of the salary, overtime hours, overtime rate and pay deductibles fields implemented ("s/","oth/", "otr/", "de/" respectively) (Pull Requests https://github.com/CS2103-AY1819S1-T13-2/main/pull/10[#10], https://github.com/CS2103-AY1819S1-T13-2/main/pull/41[#41]).
** Tweaked the staff panel to be able to display the net salary. Net salary in this case refers to the final salary calculated after all additions and deductions are taken into account. (Pull Request https://github.com/CS2103-AY1819S1-T13-2/main/pull/53[#53])
